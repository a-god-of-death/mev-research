# MEV in L2: Evolving MEV Extraction in Layer 2 Systems with Flashbots

## Summary

This research proposal aims to delve into the dynamics of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) extraction in Layer 2 (L2) systems, focusing on how Flashbots can contribute to enhancing efficiency and fairness in this domain. The hypothesis posits that by leveraging Flashbots' technology, we can mitigate the negative externalities associated with MEV extraction in L2 systems, leading to a more equitable and efficient blockchain ecosystem. The methodology involves a comprehensive analysis of current MEV extraction practices in L2 systems, a detailed examination of Flashbots' capabilities, and the development of a prototype to demonstrate the potential of Flashbots in enhancing MEV extraction efficiency and fairness. The limitations of this approach include the complexity of L2 systems and the evolving nature of MEV extraction strategies. The implications of this research could significantly impact the blockchain ecosystem by promoting fairer MEV extraction practices and potentially reducing gas prices for users.

## Background and Problem Statement

The rapid development of L2 solutions in Ethereum has led to a shift in how computation is handled, with off-chain systems now playing a crucial role in transaction processing. This shift has introduced new challenges and opportunities for MEV extraction, with transaction sequencers in L2 systems potentially offering new avenues for MEV exploitation. The research aims to address the question: How can Flashbots contribute to making MEV extraction in L2 systems more efficient and fair? This question is linked to the broader Flashbots Research Roadmap, which seeks to explore the dynamics of MEV in Ethereum and beyond.

## Plan and Deliverables

The research plan is divided into three main phases:

1. **Literature Review and Analysis**: A thorough review of existing literature on MEV extraction in L2 systems, including academic papers, technical reports, and case studies. This phase will also involve a detailed analysis of Flashbots' technology and its potential applications in L2 systems.

2. **Prototype Development**: Based on the findings from the literature review, a prototype will be developed to demonstrate how Flashbots can be integrated into L2 systems to enhance MEV extraction efficiency and fairness. This prototype will simulate various MEV extraction scenarios in L2 systems and evaluate the impact of Flashbots on these scenarios.

3. **Evaluation and Reporting**: The final phase will involve evaluating the prototype's performance and reporting the findings. This will include an analysis of the prototype's impact on MEV extraction efficiency and fairness, as well as recommendations for future research and development.

The deliverables of this proposal include a comprehensive report detailing the research findings, a prototype demonstrating the integration of Flashbots into L2 systems for MEV extraction, and a set of recommendations for enhancing MEV extraction efficiency and fairness in L2 systems.
